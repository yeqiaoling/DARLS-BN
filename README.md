# DARLS: A federated learning method to estimate causal graph structures 
To meet the pressing need for distributed causal discovery, we propose a novel federated DAG learning method called distributed annealing on regularized likelihood score (DARLS) to learn a causal graph from data stored on multiple clients. 

## Getting Started
Download and install [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/).

## Running the tests
Clone the package.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/yeqiaoling/DARLS-BN.git
```

Run the **main.m** file for an example.
